## Installation

Let's first install all dependencies for the frontend
```bash
npm install

yarn install
# or
pnpm install

## Setting up the API
The project works with the great [db-rest](https://github.com/derhuerst/db-rest) API to retrieve data for current departures and trains.
A public instance is available at ```v6.db.transport.rest```

Create an .env file by copying the old one 


```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Set the API_INSTANCE variable to a host name on which db-rest is running, e.g. v6.db.transport.rest
```bash
API_INSTANCE=v6.db.transport.rest # or any other name
```
## Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
