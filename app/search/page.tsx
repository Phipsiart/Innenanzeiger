          Welcome to Innenanzeiger. Here you can select a train and then view it using the Interior Display simulation
          (a screen-like interface as if you were sitting in the same train). Bayerische Oberlandbahn & S-Bahn MÃ¼nchen
          similar screens (currently in beta) are currently supported. You can also select trains from other railway
          companies, but they will probably not be displayed correctly. As this is a simulation, the content here may
          well differ from the actual representations in the trains.
