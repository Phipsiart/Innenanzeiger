<p className="max-w-xs">Welcome to Innenanzeiger. Here you can select a train and then view it using the Interior Display simulation (a screen-like interface as if you were sitting in the same train). Bayerische Oberlandbahn & S-Bahn MÃ¼nchen similar screens (currently in beta) are currently supported. You can also select trains from other railway companies, but they will probably not be displayed correctly.
